            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe words of the <hi>Te≈øt,</hi> that belong to this point, are the≈øe, <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation or Adoration of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or any other Saint, and the Sacrifice of the Ma≈øs, as they are now u≈øed in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>are Super≈øtitious and Idolatrous:</hi> Upon which our Author fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtens this Cen≈øure, <q>that ≈øince by this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is charged with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which both forfeits mens Lives here, and their Salvation hereafter, according to the expre≈øs words of Scripture, it is a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of Cruelty and Uncharitablene≈øs to load them with this charge, if they are not guilty of it: and upon this he goes to clear them of it, not only in the two Articles mentioned in the <hi>Te≈øt,</hi> the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Saints,</hi> and the Sacrifice of the <hi>Ma≈øs,</hi> but that his <hi>Apology</hi> might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, he takes in, and indeed In≈øi≈øts chiefly, on the Worship of <hi>Images,</hi> tho that is not at all mentioned in the <hi>Te≈øt.</hi> He brings a great many quotations out of the <hi>Old Te≈øtament,</hi> to shew the <hi>Idolatry</hi> prohibited in it, was the Worshipping the Sun, Moon and Stars, or the making an <hi>Image</hi> to re≈øemble the Divine E≈ø≈øence, upon which he produces al≈øo ≈øome other Authorities: And in this con≈øi≈øts the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of his <hi>Plea</hi> for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But upon all this he ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted both the Licen≈øe that him≈øelf gave ≈øome years ago, to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> Book <hi>Of the Idolatry of the Church of Rome,</hi> and his own ha≈øty a≈ø≈øertion in condemning both <hi>Turk and Papi≈øt as guilty of Idolatry; the one for worshipping a leud Impo≈øtor, and the other for Worshipping a ≈øen≈øele≈øs piece of matter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Def. of his Eccl. Pol. p. 285, 286.</note> It ≈øeems he is now convinced, that the latter part of this charge that falls on the <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> was as fal≈øe, as the former that falls on the Turks certainly is; for they never Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but hold him only in high Reverence, as an Extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as the <hi>Jews</hi> do <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> It is very like that if the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken <hi>Vienna,</hi> he would have retracted that, as he has now in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect done the other: for I believe he is in the ≈øame di≈øpo≈øition to reconcile him≈øelf to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and the <hi>Pope:</hi> but the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire is now as low as <hi>Popery</hi> is high: ≈øo he will brave the <hi>Turk</hi> ≈øtill to his teeth, tho he did him wrong, and will humble him≈øelf to the <hi>Papi≈øt,</hi> tho he did him nothing but right: but now I take leave of the man, and will confine my ≈øelf ≈øeverely to the matter that is before me; And.</p>
            <p n="1">I. How guilty ≈øoever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet the <hi>Te≈øt</hi> does not plainly a≈ø≈øert that: for there is as great a difference between <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as there is in Law between what is <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable</hi> and what is <hi>Trea≈øon.</hi> The one Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports only a Worship that is conformable to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and that has a tendency to it: wheras the other is the plain ≈øin it ≈øelf; there is al≈øo a great difference, between what <hi>is now u≈øed in that Church,</hi> and the Explanations that ≈øome of their Doctors give of that u≈øage. We are to take the u≈øage of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from her Publick <hi>Offices,</hi> and her authori≈øed <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices;</hi> ≈øo that if <hi>the≈øe</hi> have a Conformity

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. If <hi>Idolatry</hi> was a Crime punishable by <hi>Death</hi> under the <hi>Old Te≈øtament,</hi> that does not at all concern us: nor does the <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> authori≈øe the people to kill all <hi>Idolaters:</hi> unle≈øs our Author can prove, that we believe our ≈øelves to be under all the Political and Judiciary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mo≈øes:</hi> and even among the <hi>Jews</hi> the execution of that ≈øevere Law, belonged either to the Magi≈øtrate, or to ≈øome authori≈øed and In≈øpired per≈øon, who as a Zealot might execute the Law, when the Magi≈øtrate was wanting to his duty. So that this was writ Invidiou≈øly, only as it ≈øeems to Inflame the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> the more again≈øt us. But the ≈øame <hi>Calvini≈øt Prince,</hi> that has expre≈ø≈øed ≈øo ju≈øt an aver≈øion to the repealing the <hi>Te≈øt,</hi> has at the ≈øame time shewed ≈øo mercifull an Inclination towards the <hi>Ro. Catholicks,</hi> that of all the Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the World, one that intended to plead for that Religion ought to have avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the mentioning of Blood or Cruelty with the greate≈øt care.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is true, we cannot help belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Idolatry is a damnable ≈øin, that shuts men out of the Kingdom of Heaven: and if every ≈øin in which a man dies without repentance, does it, much more this, which is one of the greate≈øt of all ≈øins. But yet after all, there is Mercy for <hi>Sins of Ignorance,</hi> upon mens general repentance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øince God alone knows the degrees of mens knowledge and of their Ignorance, and how far it is either <hi>Affected</hi> on the one hand, or <hi>Invincible</hi> on the other; we do not take upon us to enter into Gods Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, or to Judg of the Salvation or Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of particular per≈øons; nor mu≈øt we be bya≈ø≈øed in our Enquiry into the nature of any ≈øin, either by a fond regard to the ≈øtate of our Ance≈øtors, or by the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect that we owe to tho≈øe who are over us in Civil matters. In this ca≈øe things are what God has declared them to be: We can neither make them better nor wor≈øe than he has made them: and we are only to Judge of things, leaving per≈øons to the merciful as well as the ju≈øt and dreadful judgment of God.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. All the ≈øtir that our Author keeps with the examining of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> under the <hi>Old Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ≈øuppo≈øing it were all true, will ≈øerve no more for acquitting the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than a Plea would avail a Criminal, who were arraigned of <hi>high Trea≈øon</hi> for Coyning Money or for Counterfeiting the Kings Seal, in which one should ≈øet forth that <hi>High Trea≈øon</hi> was the <hi>Murdering the King, or the levying war again≈øt him,</hi> and that therefore the Criminal who was guilty of neither of the≈øe two, ought to be acquitted. <hi>Idolatry</hi> as well as <hi>Trea≈øon</hi> is a Comprehen≈øive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and has many different branches: ≈øo that tho the Worshipping the Ho≈øt of heaven, or the Worshipping an Image as a re≈øemblance of the Divinity, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the highe≈øt degrees of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet many other corruptions in the Worship of God are ju≈øtly reducible ro it, and may be termed not only <hi>Idolatrous</hi> but <hi>Idolatry</hi> it ≈øelf.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Our Saviour in his ≈øermon on the Mount has shewed us how many ≈øins are reducible to the ≈øecond Table of the Law, be≈øides tho≈øe of <hi>Murder, Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. that are expre≈øly named in it: and tho the <hi>Jews</hi> in that time having delivered them≈øelves entirely from the ≈øin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to which their Fathers were ≈øo prone, gave him no occa≈øion of commenting on the fir≈øt and ≈øecond Commandment, yet by the parity of things we may conclude, that many ≈øins are reducible to them, be≈øides tho≈øe that are expre≈ø≈øely named. And tho we have not ≈øo compleat a Hi≈øtory of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Neighbouring Nations to <hi>Iudea,</hi> before the Captivity, yet we do certainly know what was the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of which the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were guilty when the <hi>New</hi> Te≈øtament was writ. And tho the greate≈øt part of the <hi>New Te≈øtament</hi> is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten chiefly with relation to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who≈øe freedom from <hi>Idolatry</hi> gave no occa≈øion to

               </gap>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:29948:3"/> made plainer than the matter of Fact is. We know likewi≈øe, that when the Controver≈øy aro≈øe concerning the Godhead of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øius</hi> and the other <hi>Fathers,</hi> made u≈øe of the ≈øame Argument again≈øt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him; that they could not be excu≈øed from the ≈øin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in worshipping and Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, whom they believed to be only a Creature: which shews, that it was the ≈øen≈øe of the Chri≈øtians of that Age, that all Acts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, and in particular, all Prayers that were offered up to any that was not truely and by nature <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Eternal God,</hi> were ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Acts of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> So that upon the whole matter, it is clear, that the worshipping the true <hi>God</hi> under a Corporeal Repre≈øentation, and the worshipping or Invocating of Creatures, tho in an Inferiour degree, was taxed by the Apo≈øtles and by the Primitive Church as <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous.</hi> When they accu≈øe them for tho≈øe Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Divine worship, they did not con≈øider the ≈øoftning excu≈øes of more refined men, ≈øo much as the acts that were done, which to be ≈øure do always carry the ≈øtupid Vulgar to the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt degrees of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> and thetefore every ≈øtep towards it is ≈øo ≈øeverely forbid by God: ≈øince upon one ≈øtep made in the publick worship, the people are ≈øure to make a great many more in their notions of things. Therefore if we should accu≈øe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for all the exce≈ø≈øes of the pa≈øt Ages, or of the more Ignorant <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in the pre≈øent Age, ≈øuch as <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> even this might be in ≈øome degree well grounded; becau≈øe the publick and authori≈øed <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> has given the ri≈øe to all tho≈øe Di≈øorders: and even in this, we should but Copy after the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who always repre≈øent the <hi>Pagan Idolatry</hi> not as <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> had done it, but according to the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt notions and practices of the Vulgar.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29948:4"/> Worshippers, believing this to be truely the Body of Chri≈øt, ≈øave the matter, if indeed it is not ≈øo. This may no doubt go a great way to ≈øave them≈øelves, and to bring their ≈øin into the the cla≈øs of the ≈øins of Ignorance: but what large thoughts ≈øoever we may have of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God to their per≈øons, we can have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence for an Act of Divine <hi>Adoration,</hi> which is directed to an Object that we are either ≈øure is <hi>Bread,</hi> or we are ≈øure of nothing el≈øe.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. As for the <hi>Invocation and Adoration of the B. Virgin and the Saints,</hi> I shall offer only three Cla≈ø≈øes of In≈øtances to prove it <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> 1. In the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Ma≈øs</hi> on many of the <hi>Saints days,</hi> that <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which is no other than the <hi>Body and Blood of Chri≈øt,</hi> according to them, is offered up to the honour of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and they pray to God, to accept of it thro the Saints Interce≈ø≈øion. One would think, it were enough to offer up the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of prayers and prai≈øes to them: but here is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which carries in the plain words of it, the mo≈øt ab≈øurd <hi>Idolatry</hi> that is po≈ø≈øible; which is the offering up the <hi>Creator</hi> to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a <hi>Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Prayers and Hymns that are in their publick <hi>Offices,</hi> there are Petitions offered up to the Saints, that in the plain ≈øen≈øe of the words import their pardoning our ≈øins, and changing our hearts. The daily prayer to the <hi>Virgin</hi> goes far this way: <hi>Tu nos ab ho≈øte protege, &amp; hora mortis ≈øu≈øcipe:</hi> Do thou protect us from our Enemy, and receive us in the hour of death. Another goes yet further: <hi>Culpas no≈øtras ablue, ut perennis ≈øedem gloriae, per te redempti, valeamus ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere:</hi> Wash thou away our ≈øins, that ≈øo being redeemed by thee, we may a≈øcend up to the man≈øions of glory. That to the <hi>Angels</hi> is of the ≈øame nature, <hi>No≈øtra diluant jam peccata prae≈øtando ≈øupernam Coeli gloriam:</hi> May they wash away our ≈øins, and grant us the heavenly glory. I shall to this add two Addre≈ø≈øes to two of our <hi>English</hi> Saints; the fir≈øt is to St. Alban, <hi>Te nunc petimus Patrone praeco ≈øedule, qui es no≈øtra vera gloria, ≈øolve precum votis, ≈øervorum ≈øcelera:</hi> We implore thee, our Patron, who art our true Glory, do thou take away the crimes of thy Servants, by thy prayers. And the other relates to <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> whom I believe, our Author will not deny to have been as great a Rebel, as either <hi>Coligny,</hi> or his Faction; and yet they pray thus to Chri≈øt, <hi>Tu per Thomae ≈øanguinem, quem pro te effudit, fac nos Chri≈øte ≈øcandere quo Thomas a≈øcendit.</hi> Do thou, O Chri≈øt, make us by the <hi>blood of Thomas, which he shed for thee,</hi> to a≈øcend up whether he has a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended: and the Hymn upon him, is that Ver≈øe of the eighth P≈øalm, <hi>Thou ha≈øt crowned him with Glory and Honour, and has ≈øet him over all the works of thy hands.</hi> One would think, it were no bold thing to pronounce all this, and innumerable more In≈øtances, which might be brought to the ≈øame purpo≈øe, to be <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> If we are ≈øent by our Author to the ≈øen≈øes that may be put on the≈øe words, I shall only ≈øay with relation to that, that the <hi>Te≈øt</hi> condemns the Devotions as <hi>they are u≈øed in the Roman Church:</hi> ≈øo this belongs to the plain ≈øen≈øe of the words, and if it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed that the≈øe are <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> as a≈øcribing to Creatures the right of pardoning ≈øin, and of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Kingdom of Heaven, which are main parts of the Divine glory, then the matter of the <hi>Te≈øt</hi> is ju≈øtified.</p>
            <p>A third ≈øort of In≈øtance is in the prayer that comes after the Prie≈øt has pronounced the words of Ab≈øolution, <hi>Pa≈ø≈øio Domini no≈øtri Je≈øu Chri≈øti, merita B. Mariae Virginis, &amp; omnium Sanctorum, &amp; quicquid boni feceris, vel mali ≈øu≈øtinueris, ≈øint tibi in remi≈ø≈øionem peccatorum, augmentum gratiae, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium vitae aeternae:</hi> May the Pa≈ø≈øion of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the merits of the B. Virgin, and all the Saints, and all the good thou ha≈øt done, or the evil that thou ha≈øt ≈øuffered, be to thee effectual, for the remi≈ø≈øion of thy ≈øins, the encrea≈øe of grace, and the reward of Eternal life. <hi>Ab≈øolution</hi> in its true and un≈øophi≈øticated meaning, being the declaration made to a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent of the mercys of God in Chri≈øt, according to the Go≈øpel, I would gladly know, what milder Cen≈øure is due to the mixing the merits of the <hi>Virgin</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi> with the Pa≈ø≈øion of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> in order to the obtaining this Go≈øpel pardon, with all the effects of it, than this of our <hi>Te≈øt,</hi> that it is <hi>Idolatrous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now examined the two points, in which our Author thought fit to make an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without de≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the particulars of his <hi>Plea</hi> more minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I have u≈øed him in this more gently than he de≈øerves: for as I examined his <hi>Rea≈øonings,</hi> I found all along both ≈øo much Ignorance, and ≈øuch gro≈øs disingenuity, that I had ≈øome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to re≈øtrain my ≈øelf, from flying out on many occa≈øions: but I re≈øolved to pur≈øue the≈øe two points, with the gravity of ≈øtile which the matter required, without entangling the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, with ≈øuch unplea≈øant digre≈ø≈øions, as the di≈øcovery of his <hi>Errors</hi> might have led me to. And I thought it enough to free unwary Readers from the mi≈øtakes into which his Book might lead them, without encrea≈øing the contempt belonging to the Writer, who has now enough upon him; but I pray, God grant him Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and a better mind.</p>
